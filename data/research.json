To achieve this, we conduct observations of plant-animal interactions in grasslands, forests, and deserts, collecting samples and designing experiments to map out realistic ecological interaction networks.",

Our goal is to uncover and predict how ecological interaction networks and biodiversity respond to climate change and human activities.",
